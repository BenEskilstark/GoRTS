  - simplewww:
    - add a view-router tag that handles which of its children to display
      at a time based on screen state (or add this to stateful-client?)

  - bugs:
    - issue on server with clients not disconnecting on refresh


  - profiling how many games/clients/apm can be supported simultaneously
    - dispatch action queue as a single action at the start of your turn
    - confirm whether this is just unfocused browser windows losing the
      socket connection
    - perhaps try having the server set the timer
    - also try deploying to NY server instead of SF

  - more interesting game mechanics
    - click and drag:
      - refactor to move click handling of the canvas inside GameBoard class
    - falling pieces:
      - state for pieces that are falling (and handling whether another placement
        there would be legal)
      - timing for falling pieces to become regular pieces
      - rendering of falling pieces as increasing-sized circles inside an outline
        of their final position
    - mana:
      - state for how many pieces available to place, and you don't place them if
        there is no mana for it
      - rate that mana is added (could be interested if there is none)
      - display mana somewhere (along the bottom?)

  - scoring:
    - count and display number of pieces lost to being captured (as negative)
    - use floodfill algorithm on empty squares to count them up
      - how to handle ambiguous areas?
