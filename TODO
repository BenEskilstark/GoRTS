  - playtest:
    - can drag around the same spot and lose mana without placing more pieces


  - bugs:
    - DROP_PIECE must provide its number of turns on dispatch


  - open issues:
    - turn rate timing is too noisy -- use a running average?


  - profiling how many games/clients/apm can be supported simultaneously
    - dispatch action queue as a single action at the start of your turn
      (and always queue actions)


  - more interesting game mechanics


  - scoring:
    - count and display number of pieces lost to being captured (as negative)
    - use floodfill algorithm on empty squares to count them up
      - how to handle ambiguous areas?
