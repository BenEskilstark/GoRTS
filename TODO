  - playtest:


  - bugs:


  - profiling how many games/clients/apm can be supported simultaneously
    - dispatch action queue as a single action at the start of your turn
      (and always queue actions)


  - more interesting game mechanics


  - scoring:
    - count and display number of pieces lost to being captured (as negative)
    - use floodfill algorithm on empty squares to count them up
      - how to handle ambiguous areas?
