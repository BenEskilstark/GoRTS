  - Need more succinct way to access dispatch, getState, etc. from within html
  - More streamlined way to create new html web components than having to do the
    register state/(un)subscribe rigamarole

  - Add an AI tag that places pieces at random on its turn
  - Implement Go liberty rules
  - Add switch for turn-based vs real-time
    - turn-based ends your turn whenever you place a piece
    - real-time queues up placements made not on your own turn and then
      dispatches them if they are legal on your turn
