  - Need more succinct way to access dispatch, getState, etc. from within html

  - Add switch for turn-based vs real-time
    - turn-based ends your turn whenever you place a piece
    - real-time queues up placements made not on your own turn and then
      dispatches them if they are legal on your turn
