  - playtest:

  - bugs:


  - profiling how many games/clients/apm can be supported simultaneously
    - dispatch action queue as a single action at the start of your turn
      (and always queue actions)

  - more interesting game mechanics
    - falling pieces:
      - state for pieces that are falling (and handling whether another placement
        there would be legal)
      - timing for falling pieces to become regular pieces
      - rendering of falling pieces as increasing-sized circles inside an outline
        of their final position

  - scoring:
    - count and display number of pieces lost to being captured (as negative)
    - use floodfill algorithm on empty squares to count them up
      - how to handle ambiguous areas?
