  - playtest:
    - can drag around the same spot and lose mana without placing more pieces
      - because we subtract mana before dropping the piece?
    - tabbing away pauses the socket and messes with avg TR


  - bugs:


  - open issues:
    - each client should be tracking all game state precisely


  - profiling how many games/clients/apm can be supported simultaneously
    - dispatch action queue as a single action at the start of your turn


  - more interesting game mechanics


  - scoring:
    - count and display number of pieces lost to being captured (as negative)
    - use floodfill algorithm on empty squares to count them up
      - how to handle ambiguous areas?
